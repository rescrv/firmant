    The difference between this class and
    :class:`firmant.parsers.static.StaticObject` is this class is parsed from
    a restructured text document while the other is only from filesystem
    information.

    Attributes of :class:`StaticRstObject`:

        title
           The title from the parsed restructured text document.

        path
           The path relative to the root where the static objects are stored.

        content
           The content of the restructured text document.  This includes the
           title and subtitle components from the docutils writer.
