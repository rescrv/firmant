    '''A post is piece of content identified by a date of publication and a
    slug.

    Attributes of :class:`Post`:

        slug
           A unique string that identifies the post.

        published
           The date and time of publication of the post.

        title
           A longer title used for identifying the post to the user.

        author
           The person who authored the post.

        copyright
           The copyright of the post.  Absence of a copyright implies all rights
           are reserved (except in the case that a post without a copyright
           belongs to a feed with a copyright).

        content
           The content of the restructured text document.  This does not include
           the title information.

        updated
           The time at which the post was last updated (defaults to the time of
           publication).

        tags
           A list of cross-referenced tags.  This will contain only slugs until
           cross-referencing happens at a later point in time.

        feeds
           A list of cross-referenced feeds.  This will contain only slugs until
           cross-referencing happens at a later point in time.

    .. note::

       All string attributes except `slug` may be ``''``.  Posts will be ``[]``
       until the cross-referencing chunk happens.
